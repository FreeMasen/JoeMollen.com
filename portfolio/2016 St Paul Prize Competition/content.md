LIVE/WORK Trail is a ten unit, four storefront development with a focus on two LIVE/WORK startup storefronts, and two larger corner storefronts that turn the retail corridor of Payne Ave east to connect to the Bruce Vento Trail. Outside, a concrete smokestack mirrors the historic Hamm's Brewery stack, and marks the beginning of the TRAIL. Metered concrete planes march away from the building in increasing distances reaching out to the TRAIL. Community garden plots are disbursed in the landscape between the TRAIL and the indoor/outdoor community room in the southeast corner of the site, bridging the gap between public and private space.
