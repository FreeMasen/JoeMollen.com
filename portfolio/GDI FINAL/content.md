This project centered on creating a restaurant for a client that would reflect the attitude of the client. In this case, the client was NY Bite Club; a members only underground supper club. It provides a high end dining experience in an exclusive, though casual, setting. Because of the somewhat clandestine nature of the client, the site is below an alley, and the main difficulty in the project was bringing in light to the space, which was achieved through perforations and slits in the ceiling.}
