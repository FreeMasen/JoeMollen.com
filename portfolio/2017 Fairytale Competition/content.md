When I was young things were different. There are still vague memories, flashes of the way things were.  I can remember it was my first trip north to see my family; the cool northern air was very new to me.
 
As we walked through the city, a swift breeze pushed between the buildings and caressed my skin. It was altogether a strange new feeling, my hairs standing up on end. It scared me at first, but my grandfather eased my fears.
 
“Do you know what ‘snow’ is?” my grandfather asked me.
“No.” I replied
“I didn’t think so,” he smiled.
 
“When I was young, about your age, my father told me that they used to have to thick puffy jackets when it snowed.”
“Snowed?”
“Snow is… well, snow was a white powder that would fall from the sky--”
“Like rain?”
“--yes, but it was soft. And cold... and it fell slowly, and when it landed it would cover everything in a white blanket.”
 
I looked at him, confused. What did he mean white blanket?
 
“I know it sounds strange,” he chuckled. “You’ll see what I mean.”
 
After two more blocks we arrived at the corner of fifth and seventh, my grandfather wanted me to see the new Shared History Museum. It was important for me to see the great northern beasts that had once roamed this region.
 
We walked through the museum slowly.
I had never been to a museum.
 
Grandfather brought me through the museum, answering any questions I had. He always said curiosity was a gift, and that I should always keep mine.
 
"Promise me you'll look, they are just bones.You have them too."
 
“What is a wolf? Is it a dog?” I asked.
 
“The wolves,” he exclaimed, “The wolves were so majestic! And yes you’re right! Dogs descended from wolves, their great wild ancestor”
 
“What happened to them? We still have dogs don't we?” I asked.
 
“Yes, dogs still exist, but the wolves, they lived off the deer and other animals, which lived of the plants, which grew and changed with the seasons,” my grandfather explained. “Those seasons used to be much different, and the plants simply couldn't adapt quick enough, so the deer lost their food source, and eventually the wolves did too.”
 
“We still have deer though right?”
 
“Well yes, they eventually migrated, but the wolves did not.”
 
“So sad, all these innocent creatures lost because of reckless indifference....” muttered my grandfather under his breath.
 
“Why didn’t we do anything?” I asked.
 
“... we didn't think it could happen.” My grandfather said softly, “My child, you must understand this, the blessings that come in abundance cannot be taken for granted. Nature’s charity is fleeting, and when it’s charity ceases, it’s the most innocent that feel the wrath.”
 
It was my last trip north, and it was the last time I saw my grandfather. He taught me to read, and talked to me about the history of our planet. He was always curious to learn more. I loved his stories, his voice, his patience. I couldn't quite comprehend at the time what I had seen and heard at the museum that day, I wish he had pressed upon me more, the importance of choice. I wish people in his time knew that they had a choice.
 
We get along well enough now; I have a family and a shelter, although the streets we walk are much different.
 
As I wander through the nearly empty, and on this rare occasion, dry streets of the Information & History District, I pass a crowd of people standing around the battery ration center.
 
Through a loudspeaker, a county official sternly proclaims:
“PLEASE QUEUE IN AN ORDERLY FASHION! PREPARE TO SHOW YOUR STATE IDENTIFICATION CARDS! ALL CITIZENS WILL RECEIVE RATIONS!”
 
It’s near impossible to acquire an identification card through Dade County, so residents have to barter and trade for batteries. I’m one of the lucky ones, I was able to buy a fake ID off an inlander, now I can make cash on the side selling batteries.
 
We live in the harvester district with my son and wife. My wife works on the plastic reprocessing barges, and my son helps me harvest copper and other valuable metals from buildings in lowertown.
 
Harvesters migrate between the harbour and the city with the tides. It’s a dangerous life, navigating into the lowertown mangroves. Capsized boats tangled in the mangrove forest, serve as a reminder, that only the most skilled can navigate these canals during high tides.
 
As the tide swells through lowertown, harvesters inundate the buildings, ripping them to their bones. It’s almost like the natural cycle of the world, an animal dies, organic matter is recycled in an ecosystem by decomposers. Harvesters are the decomposers, much like bacteria and fungi, harvesters break down the built environment, the dead bodies of the city. The harvesters deconstruct the component parts of a building into the raw materials. Some harvesters will latch their portaledge onto the exterior of the decaying building, living for weeks like a parasite on a host, until they’ve sucked all they can out of the building.
 
It’s not the life I want for my son. I want him to have a better life. We’re the bottom of the food chain, living off detritus. That's no way to live, that's not what I want to leave behind. He reminds me so much of my Grandfather; his patience, his curiosity. He truly sees the natural beauty in this world. He needs to be able to choose his path; I can’t let him get stuck here like I did.
 
“The water, it’s starting to show its effects on him,” my wife comments, as she watches my son carry a thatch of wire down to the boat.
“I know….”
“I can start taking double shifts on the barge if it means--”
“No,” I cut her off. “We need to keep his lessons going if he is going to do well in the north. You’re the brains of this family, he needs you.”
 
The sun sets over the harbor, boats dot the horizon.
 
“You shouldn't be so hard on yourself,” my wife calmly leans in. “You have taught him so much, with those stories, the ones your grandfather used to tell you.”
 
“Those stories must feel like myth now, all those northern beasts gone forever.” I reply, a hint of resentment in my voice.
 
My wife pauses for a moment, “Is that all you remember about those stories? The beasts?”
 
“What do you mean?”
 
“The people in those stories were blinded by the abundance around them, unable to be bothered to make the right choices and the right sacrifices for the most innocent in their world.” She explains, “Choice and awareness, that's what our son has learned.”
 
She steps closer, as we gaze towards the pink and green rays of the sunset. It looks strangely beautiful.
 
“You have taught him to be aware of how his choices affect the things and people around him,” she says, placing her hand on my shoulder. “He knows that this world is not his own, and it will live on long after we are gone.”
 
I turn to her, as tears begin to swell in her eyes.
 
“The failure of our parents, is our lesson to carry forward.”
